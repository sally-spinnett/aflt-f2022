To encode the above language, we will need four states that encode each of the four conditions: 1) there are an even number of a's and an even number of b's, 2) there are an even number of a's and and odd number of b's, 3) there are an odd number of a's and an even number of b's and 4) there are odd number of a's and an odd number of b's."
